## playwith_rnn

Hey there!

This is a easy implemntation and application of Recurrent Neural Network. I used keras as deep learning library with "Using Tensorflow Backend" on CPU (yep!). So here's what we have: 

####Names:
This directory mainly contains a generator.py file that trains out small LSTM model and simply generates new names. That simple. 

####Text:
The Text directory also contains a generator.py file (of course different) that takes ANY text file as an input and trains the LSTM model to generate some more "similar" text. The text to be imported for training can be essays, poems, some kind of code, or even a dataset:). But, please make sure that this file contains at least 1MB of text. Otherwise, you *might* not like the results.
